# searchCompare
This program allows you to enter a number for a grid size (NxN), as well as a number between 0 and 1 for density of obstacles (zeros) in the grid.
It compares the runtime of best first search, A*, Djikstra, bi-directional A*, BFS, and iterative deepening A*

Warning: Large grid sizes will cause IDA* to time out
